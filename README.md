# Coffee Menu

I recently built a very simple coffee menu on freecodecamp.org. After completed it, i wanted to try on my own, without instructions, to see what i remembered and could accomplish by myself.
The result is very simple (html and css only) but i feel like i learned a few things (ironically, not on coding) about what's appealing design wise. I tried to limit the colors palette but wish i did the same on the menu's items. There's way too much here for too little variety. Next time, i'll limit the items, add more space and try to play more with svgs (it was my first time with vector images and like all first time it wasn't pretty).

It's basically my first project as a front developper. It's tiny and not memorable at all but now i can build more projects over this one and compare them to see my progress. And that is very valuable in my opinion!
